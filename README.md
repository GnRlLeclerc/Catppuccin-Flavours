# Catppuccin Flavours

Theme-hopping is nice, but base16 & base24 color themes are pretty limited in their capabilities, and their ports are not always pretty.
This is **Catppuccin Flavours**, a [`flavours`](https://github.com/Misterio77/flavours)-like cli tool to change themes for your apps by using existing Catppuccin themes for these apps as templates !
