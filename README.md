# Catppuccin Flavours

Theme-hopping is nice, but base16 & base24 color themes are pretty limited in their capabilities, and their ports are not always pretty.
This is **Catppuccin Flavours**, a [`flavours`](https://github.com/Misterio77/flavours)-like cli tool to change themes for your apps by using existing Catppuccin themes for these apps as templates !

Note: the original tera templates that are built in were slightly modified to be easier to render. This program does not support 100% of templates made for Catppuccin.

## Builtin Themes

The [`themes`](./themes) folder contains builtin themes. You can add custom themes in the `~/.config/cfl/themes/` directory. Your custom themes take precedence over builtin ones.
